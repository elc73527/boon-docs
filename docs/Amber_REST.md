# Boon Amber REST API

We serve an interface to the Boon Amber via the REST API described below. This API can also be accessed and explored directly through the Swagger UI [available here](../amber-static/index.html).

## POST /oauth2
Authenticates a set of user credentials provided in the body of the request. This must be called to acquire authentication credentials prior to using other endpoints. If authentication succeeds, response will contain a base-64 encoded string under the `"idToken"` attribute. All other API requests are then authenticated by including that token in the HTTP header: `"Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"`.

HTTP header values: None.

Request body:

    {
      "username": Amber account username
      "password": Amber account password
    }

Response body:

    {
      "idToken": identifier token to be used as Bearer token
      "expiresIn": amount of time before token expires
      "refreshToken": refresh token identifier
      "tokenType": type of authentication token
    }

Example:

    curl --request POST \
      --url https://amber.boonlogic.com/v1/oauth2 \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"username": "my-username", "password": "my-password"}'

## GET /sensors

List all sensor instances current associated with Amber account. The listing for each sensor includes the associated sensor ID, tenant (account username), and label. To get usage info for an individual sensor, call **GET /sensor** instead.

HTTP header values:

    "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"

Request body: None.

Response body:

    {
      [
        {
          "sensorId": sensor ID for this sensor
          "tenantId": account that owns this sensor
          "label": label for this sensor
        },
        ... (for all sensors)
      ]
    }

Example:

    curl --request GET \
      --url https://amber.boonlogic.com/v1/sensors \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"

## POST /sensor

Create a new Amber sensor instance, returning its unique sensor identifier. The created sensor ID should be saved and tracked by the client in order to access the created instance in the future.

HTTP header values:

    "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"

Request body:

    {
      "label": label to assign to created sensor
    }

Response body:

    {
      "sensorId": sensor ID of created sensor
      "tenantId": account that owns this sensor
      "label": sensor label
    }

Example:

    curl --request POST \
      --url https://amber.boonlogic.com/v1/sensor \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"label": "my-label"}'

## GET /sensor

## POST /config

Apply the provided configuration to an Amber sensor instance. A sensor's configuration determines the dimensionality and streaming window size for input data, how many samples to ingest before autotuning, and its criteria for transitioning from Learning to Monitoring mode. A sensor must be configured before any data can be streamed to it using **POST /stream**.

HTTP header values:

    "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"
    "sensorId: <sensor-id>"

Request body:

    {
      "featureCount":  number of features (dimensionality of each data sample)

      "learningRateDenominator': see learningRateNumerator
      "learningMaxClusters": sensor graduates if this many clusters are created
      "learningMaxSamples": sensor graduates if this many samples are processed
    }

Response body:

    {
      "featureCount": applied featureCount
      "streamingWindowSize": applied streamingWindowSize
      "samplesToBuffer": applied samplesToBuffer

## GET /config

Get the current configuration of an Amber sensor instance. Note that the response includes `percentVariation` and `features`, which are not present in the posted configuration. These two hyperparameters are not set by the user but rather discovered automatically during autotuning.

HTTP header values:

    "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"
    "sensorId: <sensor-id>"

Request body: None.

Response body:

    {
      "featureCount":  number of features (dimensionality of each data sample)
      "streamingWindowSize": streaming window size (number of samples)
      "samplesToBuffer": number of initial samples to load before autotuning
      "learningRateNumerator": sensor "graduates" (i.e. transitions from learning to monitoring mode) if fewer than learningRateNumerator new clusters are created in the last learningRateDenominator samples
      "learningRateDenominator': see learningRateNumerator
      "learningMaxClusters": sensor graduates if this many clusters are created
      "learningMaxSamples": sensor graduates if this many samples are processed
      "percentVariation": percent variation hyperparameter discovered by autotuning
      "features": [
        {
          "minVal": min value discovered by autotuning for feature 1
          "maxVal": max value discovered by autotuning for feature 1
        },
        ... (for all features)
      ]
    }

      --url https://amber.boonlogic.com/v1/config \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "sensorId: 0123456789abcdef"

## POST /stream

Stream data to a sensor and return the inference result. Ingoing data should be formatted as a simple string of comma-separated numbers with no spaces.

HTTP header values:

    "Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}"
    "sensorId: <sensor-id>"

Request body:

    {
      "data": <comma-separated string of numbers with no spaces>
    }

Response body:

    {
      "state": sensor state as of this call. One of:
          "Buffering": gathering initial sensor data
          "Autotuning": autotuning in progress
          "Learning": sensor is active and learning
          "Monitoring": sensor is active but monitoring only (learning disabled)
          "Error": fatal error has occurred
      "message": accompanying message for current sensor state
      "progress": progress as a percentage value (applicable for "Buffering" and "Autotuning" states)
      "clusterCount": number of clusters created so far
      "retryCount": number of times autotuning was re-attempted to tune streamingWindowSize
      "streamingWindowSize": streaming window size of sensor (may differ from value given at configuration if window size was adjusted during autotune)
      "ID": list of cluster IDs. The values in this list correspond one-to-one with input samples, indicating the cluster to which each input pattern was assigned.
      "SI": smoothed anomaly index. The values in this list correspond one-for-one with input samples and range between 0.0 and 1.0. Values closer to 0 represent input patterns which are ordinary given the data seen so far on this sensor. Values closer to 1 represent novel patterns which are anomalous with respect to data seen before.
      "AD": list of binary anomaly detection values. These correspond one-to-one with input samples and are produced by thresholding the smoothed anomaly index (SI). The threshold is determined automatically from the SI values. A value of 0 indicates that the SI has not exceeded the anomaly detection threshold. A value of 1 indicates it has, signaling an anomaly at the corresponding input sample.
      "AH": list of anomaly history values. These values are a moving-window sum of the AD value, giving the number of anomaly detections (1's) present in the AD signal over a "recent history" window whose length is the buffer size.
      "AM": list of Amber metric values. These are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the extent to which each corresponding AH value shows an unusually high number of anomalies in recent history. The values are derived statistically from a Poisson model, with values close to 0.0 signaling a lower, and values close to 1.0 signaling a higher, frequency of anomalies than usual.
      "AW": list of Amber warning level values. This index is produced by thresholding the Amber Metric (AM) and takes on the values 0, 1 or 2 representing a discrete "warning level" for an asset based on the frequency of anomalies within recent history. 0 = normal, 1 = asset changing, 2 = asset critical. The default thresholds for the two warning levels are the standard statistical values of 0.95 (outlier, asset changing) and 0.997 (extreme outlier, asset critical).

    {
      "pca": list of length-3 vectors representing cluster centroids

          to the "zero" cluster, element 1 corresponding to cluster ID 1, etc.
